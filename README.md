Defect Density: This measures the number of defects found in the software relative to its size. It helps assess the quality of the software and identify areas that need improvement. A lower defect density indicates a higher quality software12.
Test Coverage: This measures the extent to which the software is tested. It evaluates the percentage of code or functionality covered by tests, ensuring comprehensive testing and minimizing the risk of undiscovered issues. A higher test coverage indicates a more thorough testing process12.
Test Efficiency: This measures the effectiveness of testing efforts by comparing the number of defects found per test case executed or the number of tests executed within a given timeframe. It helps optimize testing efforts, improve productivity, and identify areas for process improvement. A higher test efficiency indicates a more productive and effective testing process2.
Test Effectiveness: This measures the percentage of defects found in testing that were not detected in earlier stages, such as development or requirements analysis. It indicates the thoroughness of testing and identifies areas where additional measures are needed to improve defect identification. A lower test effectiveness indicates a more reliable testing process2.
Test Execution Time: This measures the time taken to execute a set of test cases. It helps evaluate the efficiency of testing processes, identify potential bottlenecks, and optimize resource allocation for timely delivery of software. A lower test execution time indicates a faster and more efficient testing process2.
Defect Resolution Time: This measures the time taken to resolve a defect from the time it is reported to the time it is fixed and verified. It helps evaluate the responsiveness and quality of defect resolution processes, as well as the impact of defects on the software delivery timeline. A lower defect resolution time indicates a more agile and responsive defect resolution process2.
Quality Ratio: This measures the ratio of the number of defects resolved to the number of defects reported. It helps evaluate the quality of defect resolution processes and the overall quality of the software. A higher quality ratio indicates a higher quality software and a more effective defect resolution process2.
Unresolved Vulnerabilities: This measures the number of security vulnerabilities that remain unresolved in the software. It helps evaluate the security and reliability of the software, as well as the potential risks and threats it may pose to users and data. A lower number of unresolved vulnerabilities indicates a more secure and reliable software2.
